 of the writer. Letters dealing with Spanish relations, for example, are placed in the correspondence with ~~Spain~~,, even though written by or to the Texan charge to ~~Great Britain~~, and ~~France~~,.

Before reaching final conclusions in the study of Part I, the reader should compare the corrections and further annotations and the list of addenda for Part I given in Part II. The diplomatic relations of ~~Texas~~, with the European powers began in 1837, with the sending of ~PERSON~J. Pinckney Henderson~~PERSON~ on a mis- sion to ~~Great Britain~~, and ~~France~~,. He had letters of credence both as agent and as minister plenipotentiary to ~~Great Britain~~,, and pre- sumably also to ~~France~~,.** He reached ~~London~~, in October.

While on his mis- sion he visited ~~Vienna~~, and ~~Berlin~~, also, and, in fact, undertook some correspondence to ascertain through official sources the attitude of ~~Prussia~~, towards ~~Texas~~,. In 1842, ~PERSON~Ashbel Smith~~PERSON~, then chargfi d'affaires to ~~Great Britain~~, and ~~France~~,, tried to open the way for formal negotiations with ~~Spain~~, by a correspondence with General ~PERSON~Sancho~~PERSON~, Spanish minister to ~~Great Britain~~,, and ~PERSON~Washington Irving~~PERSON~, ~~United States~~, minister to ~~Spain~~,, but nothing came of it; nor did ~PERSON~Smith~~PERSON~ nor ~PERSON~George W. Terrell~~PERSON~, who was commissioned as Texan minister to ~~Spain~~, in 1846, visit ~~Madrid~~, at all.
