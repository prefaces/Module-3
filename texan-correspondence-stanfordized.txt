rN-TEODUOTIOK 

In editing Part II of the Diplomatic Correspondence of the <LOCATION>Republic 
of Texas</LOCATION>, the same difficulties which appeared in deaUng with Part 
I have manifested themselves with much greater intensity, and 
to them have been added some new ones. The effort to restore 
the original grouping has been especially difficult. In the files, 
inclosures have generally been found separate from the letters with 
which they were transmitted and placed in order of dates-; and, in 
the records, though they frequently indicate the arrangement of the 
communications and other matter as sent or received, there is some- 
times such confusion that they become utterly useless for the pur- 
pose. Besides this, some of the letters received, both those sent 
independently and those inclosed with others, have been taken out 
of the "diplomatic" correspondence and filed with other series in 
the archives, such as *' colonization," "financial affairs," "army 
papers," etc.; and the task of discovering them and returning them 
to their places in the correspondence has not been easy. It is hoped, 
however, that, while a httle doubt remains in some cases, the endeavor 
to restore the original arrangement has been fairly successful. 

The principal aim, both in the arrangement of the letters and in 
the annotations, has been to throw as much light as possible on the 
internal relations of the Correspondence. In this way, it is believed, 
will the publication of it be given the highest degree of value for 
the investigator. The external relations, which can be so much 
more easily worked out by readers unable to reach the Texan archives 
but with fair library facilities available, have received much less 
attention. 

Part n has been a little more liberally edited than Part I. Errors 
in the original documents that are evidently the result of pure 
inadvertence have been corrected, with notes where they have 
seemed important enough to call for it, but frequently without. 
The supposition of inadvertence in the case of errors in the use of 
French and Spanish accents has been made wherever there seemed to 
be room for it. But errors in this respect or any other that appear 
to be habitual or due to want of information have, as a general 
rule, been reproduced, or corrected only with annotations. More 
freedom has been used in editing copies that there is reason to sus- 
pect as corrupt than originals and copies that appear to be trust- 
worthy.

30 INTRODUCTION. 

The classification of the correspondence has been by subject 
matter rather than by the diplomatic office or location of the writer. 
Letters dealing with Spanish relations, for example, are placed 
in the correspondence with <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, even though written by or to the 
Texan charge to <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 

The system of reference for inclosures, leading from the title 
to the letter with which the inclosure came, and thence sometimes 
to the calendar or another division of the correspondence, may 
now and then try the patience of the reader; but it has been adopted 
as that which will throw the clearest light on the history and the 
relations of each letter. 

Before reaching final conclusions in the study of Part I, the reader 
should compare the corrections and further annotations and the list 
of addenda for Part I given in Part II. 

The diplomatic relations of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> with the European powers 
began in 1837, with the sending of <PERSON>J. Pinckney Henderson</PERSON> on a mis- 
sion to <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. He had letters of credence both 
as agent and as minister plenipotentiary to <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, and pre- 
sumably also to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.** He reached <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in October. The 
efforts to establish relations with <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, 
the <ORGANIZATION>Hanse Towns</ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION>Prussia</LOCATION> were made partly by the ministers in 
<LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, and partly by special chargfe. May 20, 
1839, <PERSON>James Hamilton</PERSON> was sent to act as joint agent of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> with 
<PERSON>Henderson</PERSON>, both in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, and on April 18, 1840, he 
was appointed Texan diplomatic commissioner to the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, 
and at the same time received a second commission empowering him 
to treat with both the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>. January 20, 1843, 
<PERSON>William H. Daingerfield</PERSON> was commissioned as charg6 d'affaires to 
the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, and the Hanse Towns. While on his mis- 
sion he visited <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> also, and, in fact, undertook some 
correspondence to ascertain through official sources the attitude 
of <LOCATION>Prussia</LOCATION> towards <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. In 1842, <PERSON>Ashbel Smith</PERSON>, then chargfi 
d'affaires to <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, tried to open the way for 
formal negotiations with <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> by a correspondence with General 
<PERSON>Sancho</PERSON>, Spanish minister to <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Washington Irving</PERSON>, 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> minister to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, but nothing came of it; nor did 
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> nor <PERSON>George W. Terrell</PERSON>, who was commissioned as Texan 
minister to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in 1846, visit <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> at all. 

Strenuous efforts were made by the Texan government during 
<PERSON>Lamar</PERSON>'s administration to estabUsh amicable relations with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. 
On February 20, 1839, <PERSON>Barnard E. Bee</PERSON> was commissioned both as 
agent and as minister plenipotentiary of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. He went 
toVeraCmz in May; but the Mexican government refused to receive 

a No copies of his letters of credence to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> have been found, but they doubtless had the same fbnn 
as those to <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>.

him, and he got no further. On August 9, of the same year, <PERSON>James 
Treat</PERSON> was appointed private and confidential agent of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to 
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. He reached <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> in December, 183^, and remained until 
November, 1840. On March 20, 1841, <PERSON>James Webb</PERSON> received com- 
missions similar to those which had been given to Bee. He went 
to <PERSON>Vera Cruz</PERSON> in May, but was not allowed to proceed to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. 

On July 20, 1841, President <PERSON>Lamar</PERSON> wrote the governor of Yucat&amp;n, 
which was then in a state of insurrection against the central govern- 
ment of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, inviting him to send an agent to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> with a view 
to the establishment of relations of amity and commerce between the 
two countries. The result was a sort of miUtary convention by 
which the fleet of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> was subsidized to operate against <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> on 
behalf of both <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and Yucat4n, but no treaty was concluded. 

First after the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to accord recognition to the RepubUc 
of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> was <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. This was done by a treaty of amity, commerce, 
and navigation concluded September 26, 1839, and ratified February 
14, 1840. A similar treaty between <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> was 
signed November 13, 1840; a convention for British mediation 
between <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, on November 14; and a treaty for the sup- 
pression of the African slave trade, on November 16. For reasons 
which need not be detailed here, the ratifications of these three 
treaties were not exchanged till June 28, 1842. A commercial treaty 
with the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> was signed September 18, 1840, and ratified 
June 15, 1841. A convention of amity, commerce, and navigation 
with the Ilanse Towns was concluded April 17, 1844, and was later 
ratified by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Bremen</LOCATION>; but, doubtless b^ause of the near 
prospect of annexation, it seems never to have been acted on by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. No treaty was concluded with <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>. 
In April, 1838, before <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> was formally recognized, an agreement 
was effected with the British Government whereby Texan vessels 
were admitted to the ports of <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> as those of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>; and a 
resolution adopted by the senate of <LOCATION>Bremen</LOCATION> on August 9, 1843, pro- 
vided for the admission of Texan vessels to the ports of <LOCATION>Bremen</LOCATION> on 
the same terms as to port charges and duties as the ships of <LOCATION>Bremen</LOCATION> 
on condition of a reciprocal arrangement by <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. 

Of course, until the ratification of the various treaties mentioned, 
the negotiations with the countries with which they were made was 
on a more or less informal basis. Aft^ those with <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> were ratified, charges were sent to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> by both these 
nations; but no other had a diplomatic representative to that repub- 
Uc at any time.** The only charg6 sent by <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> was <PERSON>Charles 
EUiot</PERSON>, whose letter of credence was dated June 28, 1842, and who 

« There is good reason to believe that Mr. 7. <PERSON>T. Crawford</PERSON>, who visited <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> in April, 1837, came as a secret 
agent of <LOCATION>Qieat Britain</LOCATION> to report on its civil and political condition. Count de Saligny undertook a similar 
mission for <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> early in 1839, and Capt. <PERSON>Victor Pirson</PERSON> came openly as the agent of <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> in 1842. 
None of these, however, appears to have had any dlplomatlo authority.

reached <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> in August, and remained till the eve of annexation. 
The first charge of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> was Count <PERSON>A. de Saligny</PERSON>,** who was accred- 
ited October 2, 1839, and reached <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> m February, 1840. He 
left <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> in March, 1841, but returned for a brief period in 1842. 
Towards the end of that year, he was succeeded by "<PERSON>Viscount J. de 
Cramayel</PERSON>. Some two years later, <PERSON>Cramayel</PERSON> left <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Saligny</PERSON> 
returned. This time he continued in the capacity of charg6 until the 
mission was ended by annexation. 

The letters printed in Part II have been taken mainly from the 
file of originals received and copies kept of letters sent from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, 
and from the transcripts in the books of the <ORGANIZATION>Department of State</ORGANIZATION>. 
Book 55, from which some of them were obtained, is evidently the 
original kept by <LOCATION>Daingerfield</LOCATION> for his missions to the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, and the Hanse Towns. It is, however, the only book from 
any of the Eiuropean legations that has been found in the Texan 
archives. That it was brought to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and delivered to the Secre- 
tary of <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> is shown by the letter of <LOCATION>Daingerfield</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>, February 
2, 1846; and its contents place its identity beyond question. 

Just as this part was ready, as the editor thought, to send to press, 
a considerable mass of the correspondence was found in books which 
had not been suspected of containing it. The reasons why it had 
escaped discovery are that the mass of matter in the books is so great 
and the indexes so imperfect. The indexes are, in fact — ^where they 
exist at all — often worse than useless, in that they are misleading. 
Many of the letters in the newly discovered group belong to the 
period of Correspondence with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> covered by Part I. 
They make it possible, in some cases and to a certain extent, to fdi- 
low both sides of the correspondence where the letters already pub- 
lished had given but one. While the editor does not feel absolutely 
certain that some letters may not still <PERSON>Kave</PERSON> evaded his search, 
he hopes that little of importance preserved in the Texan archives 
and properly to be included in the correspondence now remains 
impublished. 

The editor is under special obligations to State Librarian <PERSON>E. W. 
Winkler</PERSON>, who several years ago gave the Correspondence here printed 
its first approach toward rational and useful arrangement, and con- 
sequent availability for the student. Mr. <PERSON>Winkler</PERSON>'s minute knowl- 
edge of the Texan archives and of southwestern history in general 
have made his freely rendered assistance of the highest value. Grate- 
ful acknowledgment is made also to instructors <PERSON>Walton H. Hamilton</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>J. L. Worley</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION>, for help in verifying 
and arranging the copies; to Profs. <PERSON>Lilia M. Casls</PERSON> and <PERSON>E. J. Villavaso</PERSON>, 
also of this university, for verifying, respectively, the Spanish and 

o Thus written by himself. The name is usually given in official documents fmanating trom the Freocli 
Government as "Dubois de Saligny."

Note. 



<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>D. C</PERSON>, December 24, 1910. 

The <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> suffered a severe loss in the death of Professor 
<PERSON>George P. Garrison</PERSON> during the progress of this work. Professor 
<PERSON>Garrison</PERSON> died in July, 1910, before reading a single page of the proof 
of this second part of the "Diplomatic Correspondence of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>." 
The labor of proof-reading, therefore, fell upon others, who did not 
possess the special knowledge, experience, and full equipment enjoyed 
by him. This has occasioned some delay, and may have resulted in 
some inaccuracy. 

Professor <PERSON>Garrison</PERSON> had for years been preparing the material for 
these volumes, and, fortunately, left it in very good shape for pub- 
lication. So far as the collation of the text is concerned, he gave 
assurances of completeness and accuracy. The list of material 
already published was prepared by him, and he left, to be used with 
the documents as they were published, notes explaining and illus- 
trating the subject. These have been inserted in the places desig- 
nated by him. The volume practically stands as his labor. 

The proof-reading has been done by Miss <PERSON>Catharine Bowes</PERSON>, Miss 
<PERSON>Georgia Sanderlin</PERSON>, and Miss <PERSON>Bertha M. Emerson</PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> 
acknowledges the courteous assistance of Professor <PERSON>Eugene C. Barker</PERSON>^ 
of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION>.

Sir</PERSON>, 

I have the pleasure to acknowledge several communications from 
you recently, and one from Mr <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> of the 2d Inst. ^ enclosing copy 
of a communication from Mr Poinsett Secretary of War to yourself. . 

I regret to observe that Mr <PERSON>Poinsett</PERSON> seems to restjrict the obliga- 
tions of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> growing out of the treaty with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, to 
Indians resident within the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. The prevention of any 
encroachments upon our territory from such Indians is certainly very 
desirable on our part, and manifestly incumbent on that of the Gov- 
ernment of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. But there is another description of 
Indians whose annoyances are equally intolerable to us and who are 
equally within the perview of the treaty stipulations. The band of 
Cherokees lately under the Chieftainship of the notorious Bowls* 
have been resident for some years in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, but they are orijginally' 
Indians of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, and having been unwelcome intruders 
here, have never lost their American character, nor acquired social or 
political rights here. They are clearly the legitimate subjects of the 

a There was an extensive correspondence between the oommlssioners of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and those of 
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, and between the Texan government and Its commissioner, part of which has been published In 
<LOCATION>Sinate Doa.</LOCATION>, 27th Cong., 2d Sess., Ill (Serial No. 397), <PERSON>Doc</PERSON>. 199, and <ORGANIZATION>Howe Docs</ORGANIZATION>. 27th Cong., 2d Sess. n 
(Serial No. 402), <PERSON>Doc</PERSON>. 51, and more is copied in Records of the <ORGANIZATION>Department of State</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>), Book 51. The 
main question raised in this correspondence, namely, whether the mouth of the Sabine should be inter- 
preted to mean the point where the river enters <LOCATION>Sabine Lake</LOCATION> or the point where the lake debouches into 
the <LOCATION>Oulf of Mexico</LOCATION> and by consequence whether the lake should be regarded as lying wholly within the 
<ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> states or not— is quite interesting and important; but since <PERSON>Forsyth</PERSON> refused to recognize author- 
ity of the commissionerB to deal with the question and censured <PERSON>Overton</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> commissioner, 
for engaging In the discussion (see his letter, in Pub. Does., 402, cited above), and since considerations of 
gpaoe in the publication of this Correspondence are claiming attention, the series to which this note refers 
is omitted.

Treaty stipulation on the part of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and properly 
belong to their jurisdiction and control. 

The Caddoes are more recent intruders upon our territory and they 
commenced their hostihties before they had the audacity to pass the 
line of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Kickapoos</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Shawnees</ORGANIZATION>, Delawares, and 
Several Minor bands of the <LOCATION>Creek</LOCATION> tribe are in similar circumstances, — 
and these all have combined together in depredating upon our scat- 
tered frontier famihes. 

You have probably heard of the late campaign against the <LOCATION>Chero</LOCATION>- 
kees and its results. It is not ascertained whether they have actually 
passed the Une of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> or whether they have only dis- 
persed in small parties and are meditating a cruel and desultory war 
upon our borders. They have been pretty severely chastised and we 
entertain a hope that they will give us no further Molestation. If 
they shall have crossed into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> it is important that 
some adequate steps be taken by that Government to prevent their 
returning. If they should return, it will be more than probable that 
Many of the restless spirits among the tribes lately translated to our 
vicinity will unite with them and by becoming participants in the war 
here, will eventually kindle a flame that will spread along the whole 
line of the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>. The death of <LOCATION>Bowls</LOCATION> has deprived the tribes 
resident in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, of their most intelligent and mischievous head, 
and has in a great measure subverted their political powers by destroy- 
ing their means of combination. Still they may be capable of inflict- 
ing grievious evils upon our frontier settlements, by desultory incur- 
sions, and it is very important that we avail ourselves of every possible 
and just method of prevention. 

The propriety of the application to the Government of the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> in respect to these bands, is so obvious that the President does 
not feel it needful to present any further reasons in elucidation of it. 

The Presidents health is improving. We shall shortly be busily 
employed in removing to <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>.

Charg6 d' Affaires of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, representing that ''another 
violation of the territory of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has been committed 
by a Military officer of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> " 

The undersigned has submitted that note to the President and has 
great pleasure in reiterating to the honorable Mr <PERSON>La Branche</PERSON> his 
sentiments on the subject and to assure him that an enquiry will 
be instituted into the relative facts that the officer who may be 
found to have so transgressed, will be suitably admonished of his 
indiscretion; and that such further measures will be adopted as it 
is hoped will effectually prevent the recurrence of a similar event. 
The President is sensible of the many difficulties incident to border 
Settlements where the population of the remote frontiers of Two 
Gk)vemments are put in juxtaposition. In the present instance 
those difficulties are probably enhanced by the fact that the line of 
demarcation between the two Governments has not been definitively 
ascertained and by the consequent inability of this Government to 
perfect its domestic organization in that quarter of the <LOCATION>Republic</LOCATION>. 

It affords the undersigned great satisfaction to assure the Honl. 
Charg6 d' Affairs of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> that nothing can be more 
foreign to the designs or repugnant to the wishes of the President 
and indeed of the people of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, than to intercept the harmony 
and good understanding which so happily subsists, and it is confi- 
dently hoped always will prevail between the two Grovernments.

honorable Mr <PERSON>La Branche</PERSON> assurance of his high consideration and

Sm, Agreeably to my promise in the conference which I had the 
honor to hold with you on yesterday, relative to the claim of <ORGANIZATION>Messrs 
Campbell</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Dean</PERSON>, which was presented to this Government by 
your official letter of 18th June last, I am directed by the President 
to remark. « 

That, the (Jovemment of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> feels itself bound to make full 
compensation for the quantity of bacon that was actually pressed 
by an officer of the <ORGANIZATION>Texian Army</ORGANIZATION>, from the possession of Mr. <PERSON>R. G. 
Bryerly</PERSON>,*' as alledged in your note, and avouched by the receipt of 
that officer. The only difficulty that intervenes an immediate set- 
tlement of this demand results from the excessive price which the 
claimants have affixed to the article. To render justice, is a common 
duty: to submit to imposition, is to sanction and reward iniquity. 
<PERSON>Messrs Campbell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dean</PERSON> must be sensible that no instance can be 
found in this or any other country, of inferior and damaged bacon 
having been sold at two dollars per pound. On this Subject, I have 
the honor to transmit you three several letters from gentlemen of

high respectability, all of them members of the <ORGANIZATION>Congress of Texas</ORGANIZATION>. 
But as I am in expectation of further testimony on this subject, I 
would resi&gt;ectfully suggest the propriety of deferring the discussion 
of it until more minute information can be had. 

In reference to the damages claimed, I can only remark at present, 
that the question of damages, and the amount, if any, to be allowed, 
will depend upon the circumstances of the case; and with the very 
limited intelligence we now have, it would be impossible to arrive 
at a satisfactory solution. The whole demand is so exceedingly 
exorbitant that a rigid scrutiny into the relative facts, seems to be 
indispensible to a just appreciation of it. 

I have the honor to repeat to Mr. <PERSON>La Branche</PERSON>, assurances of my 
high consideration.

Sir, Having understood that the Honl Charg6 d'Affaires of the

has claims against this Government for 10000 dollars which is 
charged by one <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> for 5000 pounds of inferior bacon pressed by 
the quarter Master of the fourth <ORGANIZATION>Brigade Texas Militia</ORGANIZATION>. Having 
been myself engaged in the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Bacon</ORGANIZATION> during the same season, 
previous to said impressment, I am enabled to say with certainty 
that at the time of tBe impressment of said bacon and previously, 
the highest price for which any was sold in the neighborhood of said 
bacon unless in very small quantities did not exceed seventeen cents 
per pound, average price from 15 to 17 cents per lb. The bacon 
taken by our Quarter Master was a very inferior article consisting of 
Jowls, Shoulders and Sides.

my understanding that, the ^boye Bryerly iirformed Majr West the

had any opposition interfered, this bacon would not have been taken. 
I draw this inference from ipstructions given to me when I com- 
menced preparing to fit out the 2d Battalion of the <ORGANIZATION>1st Regiment</ORGANIZATION>. 
I can further say that this was an inferior lot of bacon, and much 
injured by bugs worms etc. having been on hand through the sum-

small lots in the county of <LOCATION>Red River</LOCATION>, at and before the time of tak-

during that time sold for a higher price, during the summer or fall

<PERSON>Austin</PERSON> 16th Deer 1839— 

Sib, Many official engagements have caused me to defer replying to 
your note of 10th inst^ which was received some days ago. 

I cannot but regret that the phraseology of the note which I had 
the honor to address to you on the 7th instant, should give occasion 
for any explanatory discussion, and I regret it the more because 
you seem to have misconstrued its meaning in several particulars. 
I was perfectly sensible that <PERSON>Messrs Campbell</PERSON> ^nd <PERSON>Dean</PERSON> had 
exercised sufficient adroitness to present their demand in two 
distinct forms: but it was also apparent that the aggregate sum 
demanded for five thousand (5000, pounds of bacon exceeded ten 
thousand (10.000-) dollars, which is something more than two (2) 
dollars per pound for the Bacon. The three letters from highly 
respectable gentlemen, copies of which were transmitted to you

with my last note, afford ample testimony of the facts, that the bacon 
pressed was of inferior quaUty and damaged: that the current price 
of good bacon in the neighborhood and at the time of the pressing 
was from 15 to 17 cents per pound: and one of them very distinctly 
intimates that the bacon in question was taken with the free consent 
of the person in charge of it, although the receipt given by the 
Texian Officer purports that it was pressed. I therefore cannot per- 
ceive any impropriety in considering the demand as one, and the 
price of the bacon actually taken, as fairly estimated by its relative 
proportion to the amount demanded. The partition of the claim into 
two separate items, does not vary the result to this Government. 
We acknowledge to have received 5000 lbs of bacon and no more is 
alledged to have been taken. If 10072f j^ dollars are demanded 
for it we are evidently required to pay something more than two dol- 
lars per pound. The allegation of <PERSON>Messrs Campbell</PERSON> and Dean that 
20193 pounds of inferior and damaged bacon was totally lost incon- 
sequence of 5000 lbs consisting of ''sides shoulders and bones", hav- 
ing been taken from it, is too preposterous for serious consideration: 
and I am persuaded that when the facts are fully presented to your 
mind, that you will perceive and assent to its absurdity. But it is 
perfectly cons6nant to the further fact that they have charged for 
this lost bacon, which remained in their own possession, something 
more than twice the current value of the article. 

I am constrained to express my surprise that you could for one 
moment imagine I intended to cast any ''imputation" upon the 
Government of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. It is true, that Grovemment, has 
"presented" this extraordinary claim and in doing so, it has dis- 
charged a common duty to its citizens. But I should beUeve with 
extreme regret, that in this instance, presentation and justification 
were convertible or synonimous terms. I have not so understood 
it, and cannot therefore be justily supposed to have designed any 
imputation upon that government which commands the highest 
filial veneration of nearly all Texians. 

That the demand of Mess. <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Dean</PERSON> is utterly unrea- 
sonable, will I am convinced be made apparent to you when all the 
relative facts are disclosed, and then I am persuaded you will not 
differ with me in the moral estimation of that demand. Enough is 
already apparent to satisfy me on that point, and to corroborate an 
opinion founded on observation that some men of ordinary good 
repute, have small restraints of conscience in making up demands 
against a government, which is in this respect, but an aggr^ation of 
individual interests and is capable of being defrauded. 

So soon as the further information which I am expecting on this 
subject, shall be received, it will gratify me to submit it to you.
